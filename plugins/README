WHAT'S A PLUGIN?
----------------

A Plugin is a bunch of code that addresses a single concern. It carries
metainformation (such as author, name, description, version etc.) and
can hook into various places of DSpace.

See plugins/hello/init.js for a minimal implementation of a plugin.

Also take a look at app/dspace.js to learn about the Plugin API.

HOW DO I LOAD PLUGINS?
----------------------

All plugins in the config.plugins are loaded when DSpace starts. To explicitly
load additional plugins (e.g. if your plugin depends on another one), check
dspace.plugins first (it contains a list of plugins already loaded), then
call dspace.loadPlugins('one-plugin', 'other-plugin', ...) to trigger the load.

HOOKS
-----

The following hooks are defined:

* load  - Calls given function once app is loaded
