We like to think of it as [NPM](https://github.com/isaacs/npm)'s little sister.\n\n**Ender is not a JavaScript library**.<br/>\nIt's not a jQuery replacement. It's not even a static asset. It's a tool for making the consumption of front-end javascript packages dead simple and incredibly powerful.\n\n![Ender](http://f.cl.ly/items/1W0P3I3D3m3U0e1j2h1c/Screen%20shot%202011-05-09%20at%2011.31.42%20AM.png)\n\n## WHY?\n\nIn the browser - **small, loosely coupled modules are the future and large, tightly-bound monolithic libraries are the past!**\n\nEnder capitalizes on this by offering a unique way to bring together the exciting work happening in javascript packages and allows you to mix, match, and customize your own build, suited to your individual needs, without all the extra cruft that comes with larger libraries.\n\nWith Ender, if one library goes bad or unmaintained, it can be replaced with another. Need a specific package version? No problem! Does your package have dependencies? Let us handle that for you too!\n\n## MORE INFO\n\nFor more information checkout [http://ender.no.de](http://ender.no.de)",
